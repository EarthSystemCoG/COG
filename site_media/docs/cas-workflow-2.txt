CAS WORKFLOW 2

o metadata: dynamic, local, static (in order of precedence)

o workflow lifecycle: pre-conditions, children workflows, post-conditions

o class inheritance: Workflow <- Task <- Condition
	- tasks cannot have children workfloes
	- conditions cannot have pre/post conditions

o workflows listen to state changes in children workflows by registering themselves with the child workflow

o workflow types:
	- workflow that control the execution of other workflows
		- parallel and sequential
	- workflows that track execution of some process
		- tasks and conditions

INSTALLATION
