<em class="bold">CMIP5 Terms of use for unrestricted data</em>

<br/>&nbsp;<p/>
[N.B.  If you plan to limit your use of data to non-commercial educational and research
purposes, you should register for the "CMIP5 research" group, not this one.  You will
then be given access to output from all the models.]

<p/>
a) I understand that the subset of CMIP5 model output that will be made accessible to this
group has been designated FOR "UNRESTRICTED" USE.

<p/>
b) I will hold no individual(s), organization(s), or group(s) responsible for any errors in
the models or in their output data.

<p/>
c) In publications that rely on the CMIP5 model output, I will appropriately credit the
data providers by an acknowledgment similar to the following:

"For their roles in producing, coordinating, and making available the CMIP5 model
output, we acknowledge the climate modeling groups (listed in Table XX of this
paper), the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP) Working Group on
Coupled Modelling (WGCM), and the Global Organization for Earth System Science
Portals (GO-ESSP)."

<p/>
d) I understand that Digital Object Identifiers (DOI's used, for example, in journal
citations) will be assigned to various subsets of the CMIP5 multi-model dataset,
and when available and as appropriate, I will cite these references in my
publications.  I will consult the CMIP5 website (http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/) to learn how to do this.

<p/>
e) I acknowledge the potential limitations of the data obtained from this archive.
These may include (but are not necessarily limited to) errors in the models,
shortcomings in the experiment designs, the conjectural quality of the forcing
scenarios used to drive the models, and so on.

<p/>
f) I understand that although the model output has been subjected to a quality control
procedure, unrecognized errors almost certainly remain.

<p/>
g) To aid participating groups in understanding and improving upon their models'
behaviors, I will respond to reasonable requests from the WGCM for feedback about
my CMIP5 research results (e.g., reporting model deficiencies, recording CMIP5
publications, etc.).
