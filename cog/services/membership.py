"""
Service module to manage membership of users in groups.
All methods return a string code that summarizes the result of the invocation.
Currently the underlying membership model includes only users and groups, no roles.
Note that the service methods do NOT include the notification functionality, which is left in the view layer.
This is because notification messages may include link to web pages (which are built from the request object),
and reference projects, as opposed to groups.
